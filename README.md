# Star-spectral-classification.

Classification of stars into their spectral classes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes physical characteristics of stars like apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, color index, and distance. By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier, the project predicts spectral classes, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of stars.
